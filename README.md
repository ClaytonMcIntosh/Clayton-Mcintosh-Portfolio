# Clayton-Mcintosh-Portfolio

## Clayton McIntosh Port Folio

This is the first application created from scratch for the Full Stack Flex Boot Camp. The task was to create a fully functional portfolio with HTML and CSS. The main aim was to make a responsive web application using flexbox, media queries and CSS variables.

I created the design for this application in Adobe Illustrator, then coded in HTML and CSS. I challenged myself to get the content of the website as close to my vision as possible. This required some thinking and testing, but Iâ€™m very happy with the result.
